# Optic-Disc-Segmentation-Based-on-K-means-for-Glaucoma-Detection
For the paper of course "Information Processing Technology on Internet of Things " and the title is "Optic Disc Segmentation Based on K-means for Glaucoma Detection"

There are three Python files in this respitory:

     1. Kmeans.py is for doing K-means algorithm.
     
     2. crop.py is for preprocessing the image to the certain size, that is (1000*1000)
     
     3. briandcontr.py is for adjusting the brightness and contrast.
     
For the access to the images provided in this paper, please contact Yufan WANG at email: yeahyuki@163.com
